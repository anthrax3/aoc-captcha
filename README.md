Captcha solver for Advent Of Code 2017, Puzzle #1 and #2

Used this as sandbox for learning Emacs CIDER, so my commit history is a little off. Head of master solves the captcha though and I'll never use this again so whatever.

Turns out the second puzzle of the day is a variation on the first. captcha-solve-2 does solve the test input, but it's really slow - like on the order of minutes. Prior to a refactor (which involved some copy pasted code) this bombed out with a stack overflow. Might fix, we'll see.
